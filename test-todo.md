# Test TODO List - TDD Progress Tracker

## Current Status: Starting TDD Implementation

### Phase 1: Basic Payment Processing

#### 1. Payment Request Model
- [x] Test: Accept valid payment request with correlationId and amount
- [x] Test: Reject payment request missing correlationId
- [x] Test: Reject payment request missing amount
- [x] Test: Validate correlationId is proper UUID format
- [x] Test: Validate amount is positive decimal
- [x] Test: Reject negative amounts
- [x] Test: Reject zero amounts

#### 2. Payment Service Core
- [x] Test: PaymentService can be instantiated with dependency injection
- [x] Test: Route payment to default processor successfully
- [x] Test: Handle successful payment processor response
- [x] Test: Return processed payment result

#### 3. Payment Endpoints
- [x] Test: POST /payments returns 200 on success
- [x] Test: POST /payments returns 422 on invalid input (following FastAPI standards)
- [x] Test: Request body deserialization works correctly
- [x] Test: Response serialization works correctly

### Phase 2: Fallback Logic ✅
- [x] Health check client implementation with caching protocol
- [x] Fallback routing strategy (automatic failover)
- [x] Error handling for failed processors (HTTP 5xx)

### Phase 3: Tracking and Reporting (In Progress)
- [x] Payment storage interface (PaymentStorage protocol)
- [x] Payment tracking integration in PaymentService
- [x] Storage for both default and fallback processor usage
- [X] GET /payments-summary endpoint implementation
- [X] Date range filtering for summary
- [X] Aggregate totals by processor type

### Phase 4: Optimization and Resilience ✅
- [x] Smart routing logic (using health check data for routing decisions)
- [x] Health check for fallback processor (both processors checked before routing)
- [x] Circuit breaker analysis (determined unnecessary due to health check approach)
- [x] PaymentProvider refactoring (improved maintainability and extensibility)
- [x] Fee optimization routing (always prefer default processor for lower fees)
- [x] Performance optimization (health check prevents calls to slow/failing processors)

### Phase 5: Performance and Infrastructure (Future)
- [ ] Load balancing configuration
- [ ] Docker setup
- [ ] Resource optimization

## Current Status: Phase 4 Complete - Code Refactored for Production

### Code Refactoring Complete ✅
- ✅ **Domain-Driven Structure**: Separated business logic from implementation details
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Created domain/ and adapters/ folders with clear separation
- ✅ **Protocols in Domain**: Moved all interface definitions to src/domain/protocols.py
- ✅ **Business Logic**: Moved PaymentService to src/domain/services.py
- ✅ **Adapters**: Created dedicated adapters for storage, HTTP, and cache implementations
- ✅ **Dependency Injection**: Created factories.py for service configuration
- ✅ **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintained existing imports with deprecated src/services.py
- ✅ **All Tests Passing**: 29/29 tests pass after refactoring

## Current Status: Phase 4 Complete - Ready for Infrastructure

### Completed Today:
- ✅ **Async Refactoring**: Made all payment processing async
- ✅ **PaymentStorage Protocol**: Dependency injection ready for database
- ✅ **Payment Tracking**: Service now stores all payments with processor info
- ✅ **Fallback Storage**: Correctly tracks which processor was used
- ✅ **Integration**: API, Service, and Storage all working together
- ✅ **Smart Routing**: Health check based routing with dual processor monitoring
- ✅ **PaymentProvider Architecture**: Clean abstraction for processor + health check
- ✅ **Test Factory Pattern**: Maintainable tests that resist constructor changes
- ✅ **Fee Optimization**: Always prefer default processor (lower fees) when healthy
- ✅ **Resilience Logic**: Graceful handling when both processors fail



## Notes
- Following strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Each test must fail before writing production code
- Minimal code to make tests pass
- Refactor only when tests are green
