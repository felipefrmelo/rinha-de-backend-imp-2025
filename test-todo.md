# Test TODO List - TDD Progress Tracker

## Current Status: Starting TDD Implementation

### Phase 1: Basic Payment Processing

#### 1. Payment Request Model
- [x] Test: Accept valid payment request with correlationId and amount
- [x] Test: Reject payment request missing correlationId
- [x] Test: Reject payment request missing amount
- [x] Test: Validate correlationId is proper UUID format
- [x] Test: Validate amount is positive decimal
- [x] Test: Reject negative amounts
- [x] Test: Reject zero amounts

#### 2. Payment Service Core
- [x] Test: PaymentService can be instantiated with dependency injection
- [x] Test: Route payment to default processor successfully
- [x] Test: Handle successful payment processor response
- [x] Test: Return processed payment result

#### 3. Payment Endpoints
- [x] Test: POST /payments returns 200 on success
- [x] Test: POST /payments returns 422 on invalid input (following FastAPI standards)
- [x] Test: Request body deserialization works correctly
- [x] Test: Response serialization works correctly

### Phase 2: Fallback Logic ✅
- [x] Health check client implementation with caching protocol
- [x] Fallback routing strategy (automatic failover)
- [x] Error handling for failed processors (HTTP 5xx)

### Phase 3: Tracking and Reporting (In Progress)
- [x] Payment storage interface (PaymentStorage protocol)
- [x] Payment tracking integration in PaymentService
- [x] Storage for both default and fallback processor usage
- [ ] GET /payments-summary endpoint implementation
- [ ] Date range filtering for summary
- [ ] Aggregate totals by processor type

## Current Status: Phase 3 - Storage Complete, Summary Endpoint Next

### Completed Today:
- ✅ **Async Refactoring**: Made all payment processing async
- ✅ **PaymentStorage Protocol**: Dependency injection ready for database
- ✅ **Payment Tracking**: Service now stores all payments with processor info
- ✅ **Fallback Storage**: Correctly tracks which processor was used
- ✅ **Integration**: API, Service, and Storage all working together

### Next Session (Tomorrow):
- [ ] Implement GET /payments-summary endpoint
- [ ] Add payment summary models
- [ ] Implement date range filtering
- [ ] Add aggregation logic by processor type
- [ ] Test summary endpoint with various scenarios

### Phase 4: Optimization and Resilience (Future)
- [ ] Smart routing logic
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 5: Performance and Infrastructure (Future)
- [ ] Load balancing configuration
- [ ] Docker setup
- [ ] Resource optimization

## Current Focus
Starting with Phase 1, Feature 1: Payment Request Model

## Notes
- Following strict Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Each test must fail before writing production code
- Minimal code to make tests pass
- Refactor only when tests are green
