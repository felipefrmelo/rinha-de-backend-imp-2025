## Implementation Prompts for Each Step

Each step below contains a specific prompt for implementing that functionality:

### Step 0 Implementation Prompt:
```
Set up comprehensive profiling for the Rinha de Backend payment intermediary system to identify performance bottlenecks before optimization. Install and configure profiling tools: cargo-flamegraph for CPU profiling, tokio-console for async task monitoring, and database query analysis tools. Profile the current API endpoints (POST /payments, GET /payments-summary) under realistic load to measure response times and identify the slowest operations. Profile the payment worker message processing pipeline to find bottlenecks in queue processing. Analyze database connection usage and query performance. Measure baseline p99 latency and create detailed performance documentation. The goal is to identify where the major performance issues are occurring so optimization efforts can be focused on the right areas.
```

### Step 1 Implementation Prompt:
```
Enhance the database schema for the Rinha de Backend payment intermediary system. Add tables for health_checks (processor_name, is_healthy, last_checked, min_response_time, failure_count), payment_attempts (id, correlation_id, processor_used, attempt_number, success, error_message, response_time_ms, attempted_at), and enhance the existing processed_payments table with additional timing and performance metrics (processing_time_ms, processor_response_time_ms, created_at, updated_at). Create proper indexes for query performance, especially on correlation_id, processor fields, and timestamp fields. Update the init.sql file and ensure the schema supports the health monitoring and retry logic needed for intelligent processor selection.
```

### Step 2 Implementation Prompt:
```
Create a comprehensive health check monitoring system for both payment processors. Implement a HealthChecker service that monitors both default and fallback processors, respecting the 5-second rate limit per processor. Store health status with timestamps in the database. The service should track: is_healthy status, min_response_time, last_checked timestamp, and failure_count. Create a background task that continuously monitors both processors and updates their health status. Add debug endpoints to view current health status. Ensure thread-safe access and proper error handling when processors are unavailable.
```

### Step 3 Implementation Prompt:
```
Refactor the payment worker to support both default and fallback processors intelligently. Update the PaymentProcessor struct to handle both endpoints (payment-processor-default:8080 and payment-processor-fallback:8080). Implement processor selection logic that prefers the default processor (lower fees) when healthy, falling back to the fallback processor when the default is unhealthy. Add comprehensive error handling for processor failures, payment attempt logging, and proper message processing that considers processor health status. Ensure payments are attempted with the optimal processor based on current health and fee considerations.
```

### Step 4 Implementation Prompt:
```
Implement circuit breaker and retry mechanisms for resilient payment processing. Create a circuit breaker pattern for each processor (default and fallback) that opens after consecutive failures and closes after successful health checks. Add exponential backoff retry logic with configurable max attempts (3-5 retries). Implement processor failure tracking and automatic recovery detection. Add graceful degradation patterns where payments are queued when both processors are unavailable, and processed when processors recover. Ensure the system handles edge cases like both processors failing simultaneously.
```

### Step 5 Implementation Prompt:
```
Create an intelligent processor selection algorithm that optimizes for the lowest fees while maintaining high availability. Implement a ProcessorSelector service that considers: processor health status, current response times, failure rates, and fee differences. Add fee-aware routing logic that calculates the cost of using each processor and selects the most cost-effective available option. Include response time considerations to avoid slow processors when possible. Create fallback cascading logic that tries default first, then fallback, then queues for later. Add load balancing between healthy processors when both are available.
```

### Step 6 Implementation Prompt:
```
Optimize the system for sub-10ms p99 response times. Add connection pooling optimizations for both HTTP clients and database connections. Implement request batching where possible without violating payment processing requirements. Add HTTP/2 and keep-alive optimizations for external processor calls. Optimize database queries with proper indexes and query patterns. Add an in-memory caching layer for health status to avoid database hits on every request. Profile the application and identify bottlenecks, then implement targeted optimizations to achieve the <10ms p99 target for maximum bonus points.
```

### Step 7 Implementation Prompt:
```
Enhance the API layer with comprehensive validation and professional error handling. Add robust request validation for the PaymentRequest (UUID format for correlationId, positive amount values, proper decimal handling). Implement proper HTTP status codes (200 for success, 400 for validation errors, 500 for server errors, 503 for service unavailable). Add structured request/response logging with correlation IDs. Implement API rate limiting if needed to protect against abuse. Add correlation ID tracking throughout the entire system from API request to payment processing completion, ensuring full traceability.
```

### Step 8 Implementation Prompt:
```
Implement comprehensive monitoring and metrics collection for performance tracking. Add metrics collection for response times at each layer (API, queue, payment processing). Implement p99 calculation and tracking with sliding windows. Create health check status monitoring with historical data. Add payment success/failure rate tracking by processor. Create performance dashboard data endpoints that expose key metrics for monitoring. Implement proper time-series data collection that can be used to calculate the p99 bonus and track system performance over time.
```

### Step 9 Implementation Prompt:
```
Create a comprehensive fee calculation and optimization service. Implement fee calculation logic that tracks actual fees paid to each processor and calculates profit margins. Add profit tracking per processor with running totals. Create optimization recommendations based on processor usage patterns and health status. Implement inconsistency detection for auditing that compares local payment records with processor payment summaries. Add fee reporting endpoints that provide detailed breakdowns of fees, profits, and processor usage statistics needed for the Rinha scoring system.
```

### Step 10 Implementation Prompt:
```
Implement advanced error handling and recovery mechanisms for production robustness. Add comprehensive error types and handling for all failure scenarios (network timeouts, processor errors, database failures, queue failures). Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures. Add dead letter queue handling for messages that consistently fail processing. Create manual recovery procedures for edge cases. Add system health self-checks that can detect and report on system component health. Ensure graceful handling of partial system failures and automatic recovery when services become available again.
```

### Step 11 Implementation Prompt:
```
Harden the system with security and validation measures for production deployment. Add input sanitization and validation beyond basic type checking (SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, input size limits). Implement proper error message sanitization to avoid information leakage. Add request size limiting to prevent resource exhaustion attacks. Create security headers and CORS handling appropriate for the payment processing domain. Add comprehensive audit logging for compliance and debugging, ensuring all payment processing activities are properly logged with correlation IDs and timestamps.
```

### Step 12 Implementation Prompt:
```
Create a comprehensive integration testing suite that validates all system components working together. Create integration tests for complete payment flows (happy path and error scenarios). Add chaos testing that simulates processor failures, database failures, and network issues. Implement load testing with realistic traffic patterns that match the Rinha test scenarios. Add health check integration tests that validate the monitoring system works correctly. Create end-to-end workflow tests that verify payments are processed correctly and consistently tracked. Ensure tests cover edge cases like both processors failing and recovery scenarios.
```

### Step 13 Implementation Prompt:
```
Perform final performance tuning and load testing to meet all requirements. Run comprehensive load testing that simulates the Rinha test environment. Tune database connection pools for optimal performance under load. Optimize worker counts and resource allocation within the 1.5 CPU and 350MB memory limits. Fine-tune circuit breaker thresholds based on actual processor behavior. Validate that p99 performance targets are consistently met under various load conditions. Profile the system under load and implement final optimizations needed to achieve the best possible performance score.
```

### Step 14 Implementation Prompt:
```
Finalize production readiness with complete documentation and operational procedures. Create operational runbooks covering deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintenance procedures. Add comprehensive configuration documentation explaining all environment variables and settings. Implement graceful shutdown procedures that ensure in-flight payments are properly handled. Add deployment verification scripts that validate system health after deployment. Create troubleshooting guides for common issues. Ensure the system is ready for the Rinha submission with all required files (docker-compose.yml, README.md, configuration files) properly prepared.
```
